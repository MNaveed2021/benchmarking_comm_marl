# Benchmarking Communicative RL Frameworks
This repo implements the state-of-the-art Communicative MARL algorithms for multi-robot collaboration, with partia observability and communication of each robot. For fair comparison, all algorithms are applied to A2C robots, classified into two groups: state-of-the-art communicative and non-communicative marl framewrks.
